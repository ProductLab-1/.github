# Welcome to ProductLab

## Overview

ProductLab is a comprehensive technical training program aimed at equipping Product Managers with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and contribute to the software development lifecycle. From the basics of building secure full-stack web applications to mastering complex concepts in data management, security, architecture, quality assurance (QA), and DevOps, ProductLab prepares you to lead and innovate in the tech industry. This course is a combination of in-class and self-taught learning. All of the self-taught material can be found within this Github organization. 

In each Module you will first be introduced to concepts through academic material, such as videos and articles. Then you will be challenged to put what you learned to the test via a hands-on coding project. Do not skip the coding projects, they are the heart of this program. ProductLab is here to develop your technical skills and skills are developed through experience. If you just review the academic material you'll have an extremely difficult time building the depth of knowledge required to be a good Technical Product Manger. 

Long story short: reading about something will help you learn jargon, building something will help you understand. 

## The Goal

1. Confidence. Whether thats in technical discussions with your development teams, running a live demo yourself, pushing a commit, or anything else!
2. Empathy. Understand your developers struggles better. Sometimes something that seems simple takes forever. Empathy will help you build better products (and better timelines).

## The End Result

A robust skillset in technical topics that you can immediately apply to your career. And if thats not tangible enough, you'll also have a comprehensive portfolio website for yourself! Check out the ProductLab-Portfolio-Demo for an example of what you can build.

Our GitHub organization contains a series of repositories, each dedicated to a specific module of the training course. Here's how you can navigate our materials to maximize your learning experience:

### Modules

1. **[Basics](https://github.com/ProductLab-1/Basics)**: Start your journey by grasping the fundamental concepts of software development. Understand the building blocks that will enable you to tackle more advanced subjects. For most of the repositories the instructions for the module are in the ReadMe of the repository. But since you're just starting out we put the instructions in a format you might be more used to. So just download the "[Basics Module - Assignment Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/ProductLab-1/Basics/blob/main/Basics%20Module%20-%20Assignment%20Instructions.pdf)" file to get cookin'!

2. **[Data Module](https://github.com/ProductLab-1/Data_Module)**: Dive into data structures, databases, and data modeling. Learn how applications store, reference, and manipulate data.

3. **[API Module](https://github.com/ProductLab-1/API_Module)**: Explore how to access data through APIs using tools like Postman and concepts such as REST and GraphQL. 

4. **[Security Module](https://github.com/ProductLab-1/Security_Module)**: Secure your applications by learning about cybersecurity protocols, OAuth, JWTs, and other security practices.

5. **[Architecture and Microservices Module](https://github.com/ProductLab-1/Architecture_Microservices_Module)**: Understand the considerations for making architecture decisions, including service sizing, event-driven architecture, and containerization.

6. **[Quality Assurance Module](https://github.com/ProductLab-1/QA_Module)**: Emphasize the importance of QA in the development process to ensure your product meets all acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.
